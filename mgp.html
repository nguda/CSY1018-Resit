         <p><strong>The simplicity of this website influenced the design of my site, especially the navigation bar. We where looking for a website which was professional but simple to replicate and ACME DESIGN provided us with that option. Also, another of the site feature which you can find evident of in my own site is the footer section. The footer was something I found interest in mainly because of the simplicity and the layout.</p>

            the way as the website was taking a shape began to take screenhot screen of pages that my interest, as you see screenshoot is from a web design website "ACME DESIGN"" but the page layout is really well structured is really amazing so i had to use this design on my about page as you see the line use to separate the the paragraph was eye catching t me and i to make yse of it while designing my own page.
         </p>
         <p>While designing my inner pages a factor I considered was that I didn’t want to use a layout that was different from each other, I mean it’s good to give your pages different layout which I did, but I made 2 and 2 similar whereby I made 2 of my pages like the other 2 of my pages to maintain consistency. I have to say that Acme Design was very helpful while I started my website, also tutorial on how they came about with their website was
            also important to me, it was something me and team made it worth the try, and I can say that I am happy with my design. Also my (MGP PAGE) of my contact i pinch the code in the codepen website. hope it won't be plagiarism just to let know.
