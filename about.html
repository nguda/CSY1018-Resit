               Currently studying in University of Northampton, conputer netwoorking engneering. I've always been story-teller first, long before i stumble upon computing. it all started
               with writing silly fictional film when i was younger, until the my day my brother take me to cyber cafe back in africa helped me
               discover anotehr meduim to express myself." Capturing emotions is one of the most important parts of my work. I feel strongly
               about making photographs that speak to the passing viewers, making them linger for a little while. There’s no surprise that
               photography is the love of my life, but traveling is also the blood in my veins. I’m endlessly inspired by nature and adventures.
               I love waking up to new horizons, making friends with people, and exploring the world. I love working with models, brands,
               fashion bloggers, and artists, so if you think that my photography is a good fit for you, don’t hesitate to I can’t wait
               for us to make art together and have fun along the way.
